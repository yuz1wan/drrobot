This is the official repository for Differentiable Robot Rendering. It includes the code for training robot models and optimizing them at inference time with respect to image gradients. 

<!-- ### Overview

Much of this codebase is inherited from the [original 3D Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) codebase, which we simplified as much as possible.  -->


## Setup 🛠️

Our setup has been tested with [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and CUDA 12.1. To install all of our dependencies, simply run

```
mamba create -n dr python=3.10 -y
mamba activate dr
mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install gsplat
pip install tensorboard ray tqdm mujoco open3d plyfile pytorch-kinematics random-fourier-features-pytorch pytz gradio
```

The most tricky dependency of our codebase is [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat), which is used for rasterizing Gaussians. We recommend visiting their installation instructions if the plain `pip install` doesn't work. 
 
# Real-Time Robot Reconstruction Demo 😎

To launch the real-time reconstruction demo, you may use the pre-trained UR5 robot model that we include in this repo by simply running
```bash
python gradio_app_realtime.py --model_path assets/ur
```

</div>

In this demo, you may tweak with MuJoCo robot parameters through the sliders, and the 3D Gaussian robot will be optimized in real-time to reconstruct the ground-truth robot pose. 

# Training 🚂

The training is divided into two phases
1. **Data generation**, which takes in a URDF file and generates randomly sampled combinations of images + camera poses + robot joint angles.
2. **Differentiable robot training stage**, which trains a canonical 3D Gaussian and a deformation field on the data generated. This part is subdivided into 3 stages:
   <ol type="a">
     <li>Canonical 3D Gaussian training</li>
     <li>Deformation field training</li>
     <li>Joint training</li>
   </ol>

## 1. Data Generation 💽
 
Our code generates data from a URDF specified as an XML file. We provide several standard robot URDFs from [Mujoco Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie) to train on, which you can check out under `mujoco_menagerie/`. As an example, we will be using the UR5e robot arm. To generate data for this robot, simply run
```
python generate_robot_data.py --model_xml_dir mujoco_menagerie/universal_robots_ur5e
```
This script will launch many Mujoco workers to generate your data as fast as possible. 

The corresponding directory containing the data should appear under `data/` directory. 

```
data/
└── universal_robots_ur5e/
    ├── canonical_sample_0/
    │   ├── image_0.jpg
    │   ├── image_1.jpg
    │   ...
    │   ├── intrinsics.npy
    │   ├── extrinsics.npy
    │   ├── joint_positions.npy
    │   └── pc.ply
    ├── canonical_sample_1/
    ├── ...
    ├── sample_0/
    ├── sample_1/
    ├── ...
    ├── test_sample_0/
    ├── test_sample_1/
    ├── ...
```

P.S. this script is mostly standalone and quite hackable, so you may customize it to your needs.

## 2. Differentiable Robot Training 👨‍🍳

To train a differentiable robot model, run:

```
python train.py --dataset_path data/universal_robots_ur5e --experiment_name universal_robots_ur5e_experiment
```

This script will automatically run through all three stages of training. The latest robot model will be saved under `output/universal_robots_ur5e/`.

To visualize the model training process, you may run `tensorboard --logdir output/`

## TODO 🚸

- [ ] Fix the bug that tampers with training of some robots midway through training, some parameters were changed during the code clean-up, so please bear with us while we try to address this

## Acknowledgements 🙏

- Our codebase is heavily built on top of [3D Gaussians](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and [4D Gaussians](https://github.com/hustvl/4DGaussians)
- Our renderer uses [Gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat)
- Many robot models that we use come directyl from [Mujoco Menagerie](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie), we thank them for providing a diverse and clean repository of robot models. 
- [Pytorch Kinematics](https://github.com/UM-ARM-Lab/pytorch_kinematics), which allows us to differentiate the forward kinematics of the robot out-of-the-box
